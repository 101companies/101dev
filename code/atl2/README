We make use of AM3 and ATL plug-ins.

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

We start by modeling with Ecore.
The Company metamodel describes the company's hierarchical structure. 
The Total metamodel is basically a wrapper for a double value. (both metamodels in "org/softlang/ecore")
In comparison to "atl" this project's company metamodel illustrates subtyping. (Employee -> Subunit; Dept -> Subunit)

We use ATL (in "org/softlang") to cut and total company salaries.
With Cut.atl we transform the company metamodel to itself. The transformation basically copies a given company, but cuts all salaries by half.
Total.alt transforms the company metamodel to the total metamodel. It executes a query on all Employees, collects their salaries and adds them up.
   
"cut2.launch" and "total2.launch" provide configurations to run both transformations using a sample company represented in XMI as the source model. (in "org/softlang/data")
