The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

The package org.softlang.client.company contains the company's object model.

The Service interface can be found in org.softlang.client; as well as it's async counterpart.
This package also contains the Entry Point class Gwt. Here we describe the app's client side appearance and functionality.

The service provides methods to cut and total salaries as well as to load and save a company.
