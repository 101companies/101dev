Object Serialization

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
Each company consists at least of one department.
A department has a manager and Subunits.
A Subunit can be a sub-department or a person-unit.

We use OS to make an obect-model persitent. 
All classes of the obect-model must implement the empty interface Serializable.
