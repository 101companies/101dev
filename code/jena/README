We use Jena for RDF processing.
Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web applications.
http://jena.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
We exercise some company scenarios.


Package ...jena.rdf

We leverage Jena's basic RDF API (package com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model).
We use statement iterators to iterate over RDF resources.
In this manner, we total salaries, cut salaries, and check certain constraints.
 
 
Package ...jena.query

We leverage Jena's query engine and ARQ (SPARQL) support.
We implement some of the above scenarions.


Package ...company

We provide a builder for comany RDF models.
We also show construction code for a sample company.
The rest of the code uses the sample stored in .rdf file stored in the root dir.


See the Tests.java classes for JUnit test cases in the packages.
