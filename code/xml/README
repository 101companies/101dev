Some XML processing samples.

We use SAX, DOM, and JAXB.

We also use a Xalan-based XPath processor for one example.
The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

We can compute the total for such companies.
We can also increase or cut the salaries.

The org.company package contains code generated by jaxb (xjc).

Here is the sequence of commands to build and run the project:
 
xjc Company.xsd
cd com/company; javac *.java
javac Demo.java
java -ea Demo

Here we assume that xjc (and of course javac and java) are in the PATH.
xjc is part of the Java SDK since Java 6.
All of this except the xjc step can be done in Eclipse.
In fact, there is an xjc plugin for Eclipse if you need it.
