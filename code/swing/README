Requirements:
 - The "serializable" project is required.
   > SVN : http://developers.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/developers/repository/101companies/code/serializable/


The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

This project represents companies in a Swing-GUI.
That is, one can navigate through the hierarchical structure 
and edit primitive field values (department names, employee addresses etc.).
