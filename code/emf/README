We make use of the EMF Plugin.
Update-Site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/

With the "ecore-xmi-2.2.3" jar we get XMIResourceFactory and XMLResourceFactory implementations.
Available here: http://www.docjar.com/jar_detail/ecore-xmi-2.2.3.jar.html 

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

In a new "Empty EMF Project" we model the company's structure with EMF's Ecore.
We can now ask Eclipse to derive the EMF Generator File (Right-click on the Ecore file in the Package Explorer ->  Eugenia -> Generate EMF GenModel),
with which we are able to generate the company's object model (Right-click on top tree-node in the EMF Editor -> Generate Model Code).

In the cutAndTotal package we implement functionalities to cut and total salaries in a given company.
We demonstrate the use of those classes in Main. 
By making use of EMF's Resource and ResourceSet classes and implementations of XMIResourceFactory and XMLResourceFactory we can:
  - deserialize XMI data to company objects
  - total and cut salaries on those objects
  - serialize the manipulated objects to XML data.
