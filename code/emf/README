We make use of the EMF Plugin.
Update-Site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/

With the "ecore-xmi-2.2.3" jar we get XMIResourceFactory and XMLResourceFactory implementations.
Available here: http://www.docjar.com/jar_detail/ecore-xmi-2.2.3.jar.html 

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

We use EMF's Ecore to model the company's structure and derive an object model.
In Main in the cutAndTotal package we deserialize a company (represented in XMI) into 
java objects, total and cut salaries and serialize the manipulated objects back into XML representation.
