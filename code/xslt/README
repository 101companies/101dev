We address the 101companies scenarios with XSLT.
See the Makefile for running some tests.
We use the xsltproc implementation available on OS X, Linux et al.

Tested with this version of xsltproc:

$ xsltproc -V
Using libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
xsltproc was compiled against libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
libxslt 10124 was compiled against libxml 20703
libexslt 813 was compiled against libxml 20703
