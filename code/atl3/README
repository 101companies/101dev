In comparison to "atl2" we start by modeling with KM3. Again we make use of subtyping.
We then convert them to Ecore metamodels (Right-click on the KM3 file in the Package Explorer -> Inject KM3 to Ecore metamodel).
"cut3.launch" and "total3.launch" provide configurations to run both transformations.

COMMENTS:

KM3 does not support setting Packages' namespace URIs,
so for Company.ecore we either have to set this property manually or have to use "Company" (being the Package's name) in the source models.
When we take a look at the EData Type "String [null]" in the EPackage "PrimitiveTypes" in the company metamodel, we would expect "null" to cause some trouble.
It is the value of the EData Type's "Instance Type Name" (or "instanceClassName" in XMI representation) property.
One might have expected "java.lang.String". Fortunately the ATL VM sets this property to "java.lang." + name (here "String") whatever the property's value was [1].
