We make use of AM3 and ATL plug-ins.

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

We start by modeling with KM3.
The Company metamodel describes the company's hierarchical structure. 
The Total metamodel is basically a wrapper for a double value. (both metamodels in "org/softlang/km3")
We then convert them to Ecore metamodels (Right-click on the KM3 file in the Package Explorer -> Inject KM3 to Ecore metamodel).

We use ATL (in "org/softlang") to cut and total company salaries.
With Cut.atl we transform the company metamodel to itself. The transformation basically copies a given company, but cuts all salaries by half.
Total.atl transforms the company metamodel to the total metamodel. It executes a query on all Employees, collects their salaries and adds them up.
   
"cut3.launch" and "total3.launch" provide configurations to run both transformations using a sample company represented in XMI as the source model. (in "org/softlang/data")


KM3 does not support setting Packages' namespace URIs,
so for Company.ecore we either have to set this property manually or have to use "Company" (being the Package's name) in the source models.
When we take a look at the EData Type "String [null]" in the EPackage "PrimitiveTypes" in the company metamodel, we would expect "null" to cause some trouble.
It is the value of the EData Type's "Instance Type Name" (or "instanceClassName" in XMI representation) property.
One might have expected "java.lang.String". Fortunately the ATL VM sets this property to "java.lang." + name (here "String") whatever the property's value was [1].
