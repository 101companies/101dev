We make use of an appropriate JDBC Driver for MySQL:

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.


Relational Schema (DDL):
In org.softlang.scripts we describe the company's relational schema in DDL.
The package also provides a script to populate the tables with a sample company.  

Plain JDBC:
In org.softlang.plain we use plain SQL-statements to cut and total salaries directly in the database.

Simple JDBC-based OR mapping:
The package org.softlang.or.company contains an object model, which represents the company's structure in a compositional way.
Given a database connection ObjectFactory in org.softlang.or constructs a company by using the tables' primary keys.  
With the PersistenceTool we map from company objects back to SQL data. This is, we are able to perform both sides of the OR Mapping. 
We test the persistence functionality, Total and Cut in org.softlang.or.testing.
