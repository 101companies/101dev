     The split utility reads the given file and breaks it up into files of
     1000 lines each.  If file is a single dash (`-') or absent, split reads
     from the standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     -a suffix_length
             Use suffix_length letters to form the suffix of the file name.

     -b byte_count[k|m]
