We make use of AM3 and ATL plug-ins.

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

This project has two major parts. 
In both we use ATL (in "org/softlang") to cut and total company salaries.
With Cut we transform a company metamodel to itself. The transformation basically copies a given company, but cuts all salaries by half.
Total transforms the company metamodel to a simple total metamodel, which is just a wrapper for a double value.
It executes a query on all Employees, collects their salaries and adds them up. 

In the first part of this project ("org/softlang/km3") we start with KM3 metamodels. 
We then convert them to Ecore metamodels (Right-click on the KM3 file in the Package Explorer -> Inject KM3 to Ecore metamodel).
We use Company.ecore as the in- and output metamodel of our Cut transformation.
Total uses Company.ecore as the in- and Total.ecore as the output metamodel.  
"km3Cut.launch" and "km3Total.launch" provide configurations to run both transformations using a sample company represented in XMI as the source model.
KM3 does not support setting Packages' namespace URIs,
so for Company.ecore we either have to set this property manually or have to use "Company" (being the Package's name) in the source models.
When we take a look at the EData Type "String [null]" in the EPackage "PrimitiveTypes" in the company metamodel, we would expect "null" to cause some trouble.
It is the value of the EData Type's "Instance Type Name" (or "instanceClassName" in XMI representation) property.
One might have expected "java.lang.String". Fortunately the ATL VM sets this property to "java.lang." + name (here "String") whatever the property's value was [1].      

In the second part ("org/softlang/pureEcore") we basically do the some, but construct the Ecore metamodels "manually".
"pureEcoreCut.launch" and "pureEcoreTotal.launch" provide run configurations.
