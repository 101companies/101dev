We address the company scenarios with ATL (model-to-model transformations).
To this end, an Eclipse with sufficient M2M support is needed.
Update-Site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2m/updates/site.xml

The Company.ecore metamodel models companies. 
The Total.ecore metamodel is basically a wrapper for a double value. (both metamodels in "org/softlang/ecore")

The ATL transformation Cut.atl implements the scenario "cut".
It uses the metamodel Company.ecore for input and output.

The ATL transformation Total.atl implements the scenario "total".
It uses the metamodel Company.ecore for the input.
It uses the trivial metamodel Total.ecore for the output.

Running the transformations
- Select the ATL file in the package explorer.
- Right click "Run As" -> Run Configurations ..."
- Select the ATL item.
- Create a new run configuration.
- Fill in the values to point to metamodels and models.

(The target model is usually a new file.)
